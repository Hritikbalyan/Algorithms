# Algorithms
algorithms using different programming languages

 An algorithm is a set of instructions designed to perform a specific task. This can be a simple process, such as multiplying two numbers, or a complex operation, such as playing a compressed video file. In computer programming, algorithms are often created as functions. These functions serve as small programs that can be referenced by a larger program.
